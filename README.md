# PHP4_ORM

A basic orm for php4.

I built this for a server which unfortunately can't be updated to a later version of php anytime soon. I thought I'd share it for anyone else in the same situation.

To use, just include the orm_library.php
See orm_test.php for use cases

Feedback welcome, however this won't be updated very often.
